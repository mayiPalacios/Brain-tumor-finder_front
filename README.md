# Brain Tumor Finder front 

The web platform that uses an instance of an artificial intelligence model for the detection of early-stage brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The application will allow users to upload MRI images of patients and, through the model, analyze them to detect possible early-stage brain tumors. This repository is contains the front end client to use the BTF model.

## Collaborating with the BrainTumorFinder Model

As an open-source project, we appreciate and encourage contributions to BrainTumorFinder. The project workflow is based on Development (Dev), Quality Assurance (QA), and Production (Main) branches for the Frontend, Backend, and Machine Learning (ML) model. Here's a list of numbered steps on how you can contribute to the project:

1. **Understand the project**: Before you can effectively contribute, it's crucial to understand how the project works, what it does, and how its code is organized.

2. **Identify an issue or improvement**: Once you thoroughly understand the project, you can start looking for ways to improve it.

3. **Create an issue**: If you've found a problem or have an idea for an improvement, the first step is to create an issue on GitHub.

4. **Fork the repository**: To make changes to the code, you need your own copy of the GitHub repository. Fork the repository to create a copy in your GitHub account.

5. **Clone the repository**: Once you have your own fork, you can clone the repository to your local machine.

6. **Create your working branch**: Based on the development branch corresponding to your task (Frontend, Backend, ML), you should create a new branch following the nomenclature:

    - `feature/ml-number`: for new features or improvements in the project.
    - `bugfix/bug-number`: to fix errors in the project.
    - `hotfix/bug-number`:

to address critical issues that arise in production and require a quick solution.
    - `release/version`: to prepare new project versions that will go into production.

7. **Make your changes**: Make the changes you deem appropriate in your local copy of the code.

8. **Commit and push your changes**: When you're satisfied with your changes, commit them to your repository and then push to your fork on GitHub.

9. **Submit a pull request (PR)**: With your changes already on GitHub, you can submit a pull request to the original repository. Ensure you explain in detail what changes you've made and why.

10. **Respond to any feedback**: If you receive feedback on your PR, make sure to respond and make any changes that are requested.

11. **Celebrate your contribution**: Once your PR has been accepted, you've made an official contribution to the project! Keep your fork updated with changes in the original repository to continue contributing in the future.

Remember, your contribution can make a significant difference and help to improve the detection and treatment of brain tumors. Thank you for your collaboration!
